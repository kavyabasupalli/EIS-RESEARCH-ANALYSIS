Community Partner Projects:

The South St. Petersburg Community Redevelopment Area (CRA) was established in 2015 to promote reinvestment in housing and neighborhoods, commercial corridors, business development, and education and workforce development in the City of St. Petersburg. The City is currently developing a new Commercial Corridor Planning Program that will fund both planning efforts and infrastructure improvements as future public investments.As such, the city seeks to understand historical trends related to public and private investments in and surrounding commercial corridors since the plan was implemented in 2015.  The purpose of this project is to analyze and publish relevant data related to ongoing investments and improvements in specific areas of interest. The outcome of the project may influence the cityâ€™s strategy related to investments in and around these areas of the City of St. Petersburg.
